- **`api/extraction/upload-documents.mdx`** - Document upload endpoint documentation
- **`api/extraction/extract-data.mdx`** - Data extraction with all three modes (Basic/VLM/Advanced)

### 3. Review Workflow (2 files) ⭐ **Priority for Automation**
- **`api/review/understanding-reviews.mdx`** - How confidence scoring and review flagging works
- **`api/review/polling-pattern.mdx`** - **Critical for automation**: Complete polling implementations with:
  - Basic polling
  - Exponential backoff
  - Batch polling
  - Async/concurrent polling
  - Error handling and timeout strategies

### 4. Data Endpoints (1 file)
- **`api/data/list-extractions.mdx`** - Query and filter extractions with:
  - Polling by document_id
  - Filtering by review status (needs_review, is_reviewed)
  - Date range queries
  - Pagination examples

### 5. Integration Patterns (1 file)
- **`api/patterns/automation-pipeline.mdx`** - Production-ready automation examples:
  - Batch processing with parallel extraction
  - Scheduled daily jobs with retry logic
  - Event-driven processing with file watchers
  - Complete error handling

## Key Features for Automation Developers

### 1. Review Polling Pattern
The documentation includes multiple polling implementations:

```python
# Basic polling for single document
def poll_for_review(document_id, timeout=300):
    while (time.time() - start) < timeout:
        extraction = get_extraction(document_id)
        if extraction["is_reviewed"]:
            return extraction["reviewed_results"]
        time.sleep(10)
```

### 2. Handling `needs_review` Flag
Clear examples of the decision flow:

```python
result = extract_data(document_id, schema)

if result["needs_review"]:
    # Wait for human review
    reviewed_data = poll_for_review(document_id)
    process_data(reviewed_data)
else:
    # Use immediate results
    process_data(result["results"])
```

### 3. Query Patterns for Automation
Examples for all common scenarios:
- Check if specific document is reviewed
- List all pending reviews
- Get completed reviews from today
- Find failed extractions for retry

## Documentation Quality

Each file includes:

✅ **Code Examples**: Python, JavaScript/Node.js, and cURL  
✅ **Request/Response Examples**: Complete with realistic data  
✅ **Error Handling**: Common errors and solutions  
✅ **Best Practices**: Production-ready patterns  
✅ **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and fixes  
✅ **Cross-References**: Links to related documentation  

## Mintlify Components Used

- ✅ `<CardGroup>` and `<Card>` for feature highlights
- ✅ `<Steps>` for sequential workflows
- ✅ `<CodeGroup>` for multi-language examples
- ✅ `<Tabs>` for alternative approaches
- ✅ `<AccordionGroup>` for detailed explanations
- ✅ `<Warning>` and `<Tip>` callouts
- ✅ `<ParamField>` and `<ResponseField>` for API specs
- ✅ `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` for API calls

## Navigation Structure

Updated `docs.json` with new "API Documentation" tab:

## What's NOT Included (Scope)

The following were listed in the original plan but deprioritized per user request:

- Generate Schema endpoint documentation
- Update Extraction endpoint
- Flag for Review endpoint
- Documents management endpoints
- Usage/Credits tracking endpoints
- Custom schemas management
- Error handling patterns (separate page)
- Response schemas reference
- Rate limits documentation
- Changelog

These can be added as Phase 2 if needed.

## How to Use

1. **For Mintlify Local Development**:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   mintlify dev
   ```

2. **For Mintlify Cloud**:
   - Push to your repository
   - Mintlify will auto-deploy from the `docs/` folder

3. **For Developers**:
   - Start with "Quick Start" for a 5-minute walkthrough
   - Read "Understanding Reviews" to understand the review workflow
   - Implement polling using "Polling Pattern" examples
   - Reference "Automation Pipeline" for production patterns

## Key Insights from Frontend Analysis

The documentation was informed by analyzing the actual frontend implementation:

- Extraction uses 3 modes: Basic (2-6 credits), VLM (10 credits), Advanced (15 credits)
- Review threshold default is 80%
- Polling happens on `/data/extractions` endpoint
- The `is_reviewed` flag is the key indicator for automation
- Reviewed data is in `reviewed_results` field, not `results`
- Confidence scores are nested for array/object fields
- Review flags match the data structure

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Core extraction flow documented** - Upload → Schema → Extract → Review  
✅ **Review workflow explained** - Confidence scores, flagging, review lifecycle  
✅ **Polling pattern provided** - Multiple implementations with error handling  
✅ **Data endpoints documented** - Query, filter, pagination for extractions  
✅ **Automation focus** - All examples target automation use cases  
✅ **Code examples** - Python, Node.js, cURL for every endpoint  
✅ **Production-ready** - Error handling, retries, timeouts included  

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to expand the documentation:

1. Add remaining endpoints from the backend API
2. Create separate error handling guide
3. Add webhook documentation (when feature is ready)
4. Create video walkthroughs
5. Add interactive API playground
6. Create language-specific SDKs documentation
7. Add more complex schema examples
8. Document admin-only endpoints

## Files Created

Total: 11 files
- 10 new MDX documentation files
- 1 updated docs.json configuration file

All files follow Mintlify best practices and include proper frontmatter, components, and examples.
