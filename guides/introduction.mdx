## How Documind Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Upload Documents">
  Upload PDF, Word, or image files to Documind. Each document receives a unique ID for tracking.
</Step>

<Step title="Define What to Extract">
  Specify the data you need using JSON Schema format. Use predefined schemas, generate from samples, or create custom ones.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Extraction Mode">
  Select the extraction mode that fits your needs:
  - **Basic**: Fast single-model extraction
  - **VLM**: Vision-optimized for image-heavy documents
  - **Advanced**: Multi-model ensemble with confidence scoring
</Step>

<Step title="Get Structured Data">
  Receive extracted data as JSON with confidence scores. Low-confidence fields are flagged for review if using Advanced mode.
</Step>

<Step title="Review if Needed">
  For extractions flagged for review, humans verify and correct the data. Reviewed results replace initial extractions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Extraction Modes Comparison

| Feature | Basic | VLM | Advanced |
|---------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Speed** | Fastest | Fast | Moderate |
| **Cost per page** | 2-6 credits | 10 credits | 15 credits |
| **Confidence scores** | No | No | Yes |
| **Review flagging** | No | No | Yes |
| **Best for** | Simple documents | Scanned images | Complex forms |
| **Models** | Single (your choice) | Multiple VLMs | Multi-model ensemble |

## Common Use Cases

### Invoice Processing
Extract line items, totals, vendor information, dates, and payment terms from invoices in any format.

### Form Digitization
Convert paper forms, applications, and surveys into structured database entries.

### Receipt Management
Pull amounts, merchants, dates, and categories from receipts for expense tracking.

## Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Upload    │  POST /api/v1/upload
│  Documents  │  → Returns document_id(s)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Extract   │  POST /api/v1/extract/{document_id}
│    Data     │  → Returns results + needs_review flag
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├──► needs_review = false
       │    ✓ Use results immediately
       │
       └──► needs_review = true
            ↓ Human reviews and corrects
            ↓ PUT /api/v1/review/{document_id}
            ↓
            ✓ Poll GET /api/v1/data/extractions?document_id=...
              until is_reviewed = true
